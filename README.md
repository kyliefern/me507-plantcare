10/21 - added microcontroller and motor driver

10/24 - added voltage regulator

10/25 - added decoder and connectors

10/26 - added USB to UART bridge

Notes: What are the rest of the encoder/decoder connections? How does the USB to UART bridge work? Is a reset switch necessary? How can SPI be used for programming and decoding?
